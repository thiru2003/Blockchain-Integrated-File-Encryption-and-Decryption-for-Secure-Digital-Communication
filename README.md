# Blockchain-Integrated-File-Encryption-and-Decryption-for-Secure-Digital-Communication
#Abstract
The Proposed project is a blockchain integrated secure file communication, which increases the security of data transfer over the internet. It protects files through multiple encryption and decryption algorithms, preventing them from being hacked or accessed without authorization. The Corda R3 blockchain technology securely transforms file packets into blocks that cannot be tampered with in transit. Hyper Fusion In addition, a Decentralized Private Network (DPN) is integrated to maximize the hardware performance and minimize the time taken to encrypt/decrypt data. Users are given the option to choose encryption algorithms manually or allow the system to choose one based on file priority, optimizing both speed and security. For secure LAN-based file transfers, the model features Raspberry Pi, Intel Xeon processors, and a TP-POE Ethernet device enhancing the security of the digital file communication and making it an optimized one. It is optimized to run on a Linux based OS for improved blockchain performance and uses dedicated servers to securely store encryption keys. Further, encrypted file download is developed  for wireless users with integration for browsers and hardware supported encryption system’s such as ATTINY 85 and ESP-01 Wi-Fi modules. This is designed scalable able and can be set up as a security.
